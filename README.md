## Who Am I?
I am Juliette, an EPFL Data Science graduate who enjoys turning complex data into clear, usable products. I work across machine learning, computer vision, and data-driven applications, from research to deployment, and I love making complex ideas easy to understand, a skill I refined while teaching computer science in high school.

Outside work, I recharge with classical piano (Chopin’s Nocturne in C♯ minor on repeat!), plenty of tea, and coffee when needed, and I stay active through competitive sailing and badminton.

I am currently looking for opportunities in data, AI, or software engineering. I want to keep learning, take on new challenges, and apply my skills to meaningful real-world problems across diverse industries.
